## üïë How the Two Hours Were Spent

During this two-hour session:

- **Supabase Integration:** Connected the frontend to a cloud Supabase backend table (`weights`) using a working REST API. Verified `GET`, `POST`, and `PATCH` requests with proper headers.  10min
- **Table Functionality:** Implemented adding, editing, and saving weight entries. Ensured that the save feature works with the backend. 20min
- **Data Calculations:** Implemented accurate percentage weight change calculation from the starting weight (220 lbs). 40min  
- **Chart Display:** Added a Recharts chart to visualize weight data (dates may be slightly misaligned). 15min  
- **UI/UX along with components:** Bulk time implementing it along with making it split ot different components to make code readable 20min


- **Shortcuts / Decisions:**  
  - **Pagination:** Began work on pagination just did frontend realized it might take too long 5min
  - **Docker Consideration:** Attempted Docker Compose setup; unsure if it works as it took too long spin up so i skipped it. 5 min
  - `.env` file was intentionally not `.gitignore`-d for ease of testing the API. 5 min
  - Focused on core functionality first (table display and Supabase save) before polishing chart and pagination. 
  - Table might be really hard to read just trying to make it functional adding typing. 


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues / Known Problems  
- Chart (using Recharts) does not accurately reflect the data ‚Äî dates may be misaligned or displayed incorrectly.  
- Pagination is not properly implemented; table shows all rows without proper page controls.  
- Cannot edit goals, starting weight, or current weight directly in the backend.  
- Editing a row sometimes fails if the `id` is missing.
- purposely did not git.ignore .env file so that you can run the api
